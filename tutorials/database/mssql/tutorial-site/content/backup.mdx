A database backup is a copy of the SQL Server data.
A backup is used to restore and recover the data after a failure or during database migration.
A database backup can be stored on a backup device such as a disk or a URL.

## Types of backups

1. **Full backup**: Complete backup of the database, including the data and the transaction logs at the time of backup.
1. **Differential backup**: A differential backup records only the data that has changed since the last complete or differential(partial) backup.
1. **Transaction Log backup**: Backup of transaction logs.

## Pre-requisite

* MSSQL Server
