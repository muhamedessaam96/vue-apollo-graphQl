The first thing we need to do is to setup the backend and create the database schema using Hasura.

Broadly we will need to

- Deploy Hasura on Hasura Cloud
- Setup the database schema
- Integrate with Authentication provider Auth0

Hasura Cloud will take care of the GraphQL infrastructure and hence we don't need to worry about the Ops portion of this app.
