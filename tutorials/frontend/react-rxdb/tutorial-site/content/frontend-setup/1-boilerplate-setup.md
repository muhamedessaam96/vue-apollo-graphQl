metaTitle: "Clone and run the boilerplate | React + RxDB + Hasura GraphQL Tutorial"
metaDescription: "We will clone the boilerplate for rxdb-hasura-demo and setup auth0 variables to start running the app"
---

## Boilerplate

The boilerplate for this app can be downloaded and run as follows:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hasura/rxdb-hasura-demo.git
$ cd rxdb-hasura-demo
$ git checkout boilerplate
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Now update the configuration in `src/components/auth0-variables.js` to match your auth0 domain settings:

```js
export const AUTH_CONFIG = {
  domain: '<auth0-domain>',
  clientId: '<auth0-client-id>',
  callbackUrl: 'http://localhost:3000/callback'
};
```

At this point, you will be able to login, and see an empty todo list, but you wonâ€™t be able to add any todos. That is because the functionality required to add a todo to a store, fetch todos from the store, etc has been left unimplemented in the boilerplate.

## Boilerplate code structure walkthrough

All the files we will be dealing with are under src/components/. The key files are:

- App.js: The parent react component that renders the page
- AppWrapper.js: Wrapper around App.js that takes care of authentication
- Todo/TodoItem.js: Component to render a single todo item
- Todo/TodoFilter.js: Component to allow user to toggle between active, completed and all todos
- Todo/TodoList.js: Component to render the list of todo items and filters
- Todo/TodoInput.js: Input box to create new Todo
- Todo/TodoListWrapper.js: Wrapper around TodoList and TodoInput
